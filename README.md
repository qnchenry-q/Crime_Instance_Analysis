"Justice is the sum of all moral duty" - William Godwin

One of the chief duties of the ideal state is the policing of the state in a just manner. The city of Austin houses data online for occurrences of arrests. Most of the data was pertaining to either time or location. My goal was to glean this data for insights into how the city is policed and by extension how the city can be policed more efficiently and/or justly.
